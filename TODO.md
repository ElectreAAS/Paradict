## To do before considering a release
- [ ] be drop-in replaceable on stdlib maps
- [ ] implement snapshot operations
- [ ] test for concurrent access and modifications
- [ ] benchmark performances
  - It'd be great if there was barely a perf hit moving from stdlib thread-unsafe libs
  - Measure stuff in cases of low and high contention
